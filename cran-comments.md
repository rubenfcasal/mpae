## Resubmission 

Added trailing slashes to URLs in README.md.


## New submission

The Title field in DESCRIPTION is in Spanish.
This produces the following notes when checking: 
- Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION
- The Title field should be in title case

The `hatco` dataset is also in Spanish.
Checking data for non-ASCII characters:
- Found 19 marked Latin-1 strings

These notes should be ignored.

I appreciate the work you are doing.

Best regards,
Rub√©n
